# Unit Test in Asp.Net 7 by XUnit, Autofixture, FluentAssertion and EntityFramework
This project is a sample test project that uses xunit, AutoFixture, FluentAssertion, and Entity Framework in .NET 7. It contains a set of automated tests that can be used to validate the behavior of your Entity Framework-based data access layer.

# Getting Started
# Prerequisites
To run this project, you will need to have .NET 7 and Microsoft SQL Server (or a compatible database) installed on your machine. You can download .NET 7 from the official .NET website: [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/7.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/7.0)

## Installing
To install the necessary dependencies for this project, open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the project directory. Then, run the following command:

```bash
dotnet restore
```

This will download and install all the required NuGet packages, including xunit, AutoFixture, FluentAssertion, and Entity Framework.

## Setting Up the Database
Before you can run the tests, you'll need to set up a test database. To do this, follow these steps:

Open the appsettings.json file and update the ConnectionString value to point to your test database.

Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the project directory. Then, run the following command to create the database:

```bash
dotnet ef database update
```

This will create the database and apply any pending migrations.

## Running the tests
To run the tests, open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the project directory. Then, run the following command:

```bash
dotnet test
```

This will run all the tests in the project and display the results in the console.
